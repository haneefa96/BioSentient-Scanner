### A Smart Biodegradability Grader for Real Plastics, Real Time

The BioSentient Plastics Scanner (BPS) is a handheld or drone-mounted device that uses multi-spectrum scanning and AI-driven spectroscopy to analyze plastic biodegradability in real-time. It assigns a "BioScore" (0-100) to indicate how truly biodegradable a plastic is and suggests proper disposal methods, combating greenwashing and aiding waste management.

## üöÄ Problem Tackled

Many plastics labeled ‚Äúbiodegradable‚Äù aren‚Äôt. Mislabeling causes confusion, improper disposal, and worsens global pollution.
Plastic pollution generates 300 million tons of waste annually, with 8 million tons entering oceans (UNEP, 2023). Over 60% of plastics labeled as "biodegradable" fail to degrade in real-world conditions due to misleading eco-labels (greenwashing). This misleads consumers, complicates recycling, and harms the environment. BPS addresses this by providing science-backed biodegradability assessments.

## üí° Solution: BioSentient Plastics Scanner

BPS is a handheld or drone-mounted device that uses **multi-spectrum scanning**, **AI-powered spectroscopy**, and **chemical analysis** to:

- **Analyze** a plastic‚Äôs chemical structure in real-time.
- **Assign a BioScore** ‚Äî a biodegradability and environmental impact score.
- **Detect greenwashing** ‚Äî verify false eco-claims on packaging.
- **Recommend correct disposal methods** (recycle, compost, landfill).

## üß† How It Works

1. **Scan**: Multi-spectral light scans a plastic object.
2. **Analyze**: AI model evaluates chemical structure and additives.
3. **Score**: Outputs a `BioScore` (0-100) + recommended action.
4. **Verify**: Labels and packaging claims are validated.

---

## BioScore Methodology

1. **Score Range**: 0-100 (100 = fully biodegradable in natural conditions).
2. **Formula: BioScore** = (0.4 * Polymer Biodegradability) + (0.3 * Additive Impact) + (0.2 * Recyclability) + (0.1 * Disposal Compatibility).
3. **Color Code**: Green (80-100), Yellow (50-79), Red (0-49).

## Example:
- **PLA (bioplastic)**: BioScore = 85 (Green, Compost).
- **PET (bottle plastic)**: BioScore = 30 (Red, Recycle).
- **HDPE (container plastic)**: BioScore = 50 (Yellow, Recycle).

## Use Cases
- **Consumer**: A shopper scans a plastic coffee cup, receiving a BioScore of 85 (Green, "Compost") to confirm it‚Äôs biodegradable.
- **Industrial**: A recycling facility deploys a drone-mounted BPS to sort plastics in real-time, improving efficiency by 30%.
-**Regulatory**: Environmental agencies use BPS to verify manufacturers‚Äô eco-labels, ensuring compliance with laws like the EU Single-Use Plastics Directive.

## Scalability and Accessibility

- **Consumer Model**: Affordable handheld scanner ($100-$200) using low-cost NIR spectrometers.
- **Industrial Model**: Drone-mounted BPS ($5,000) for large-scale applications in landfills or recycling plants.
- **Partnerships**: Collaborate with NGOs (e.g., Ocean Cleanup) or governments to subsidize costs and integrate with waste management systems.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repo:

## Technical Architecture
- **Hardware**: Compact NIR spectrometer (e.g., Texas Instruments DLP NIRscan), ARM-based microcontroller, OLED display for BioScore.
- **Software**: Python-based AI model (TensorFlow) trained on polymer degradation datasets to predict BioScore and degradation timelines.
- **Workflow**: 
  1. Scan plastic using NIR spectroscopy.
  2. Extract chemical composition (e.g., polymer type, additives).
  3. AI model predicts biodegradability and environmental impact.
  4. Output BioScore (0-100) and disposal recommendation.
